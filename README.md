Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews using Python, NLTK, and TensorFlow
Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews to classify them as either positive or negative. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sentiment of a given movie review. The project leverages Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for text preprocessing and TensorFlow for building and training the sentiment analysis model.

Key Features
Text Preprocessing: Utilizes NLTK for tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and other text preprocessing tasks to prepare the movie review data for analysis.

Sentiment Classification: Implements a deep learning model using TensorFlow to classify movie reviews into positive or negative sentiments.

Model Training: Trains the model on a labeled dataset of movie reviews, optimizing for accuracy and performance.

Evaluation: Evaluates the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Prediction: Allows for the prediction of sentiment on new, unseen movie reviews.
